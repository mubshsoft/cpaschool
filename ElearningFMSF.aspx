E-learning is slowly & gradually becoming a way for people to build their capacities in the areas they need. E-learning has become an immensely popular & successful mode of learning in many countries and is gradually catching up in India as well. As far as the Voluntary Sector is concerned, there are very few e-learning programs available in India. Therefore, we at FMSF decided to use the e-learning mode for delivering learning in various areas of financial management, Governance & other related aspects. <br>
<br style="line-height:12px ">
As a first step in the direction, we partnered with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) to launch a diploma program in financial management of Not-for-profit organizations. We are planning to launch a few more online training programs as well which cater to the diversified needs of the voluntary sector.
