                The emerging role of the voluntary sector in today&#39;s scenario in promoting 
                wholistic development is recognized by one and all. Historically, the evolution 
                of the sector was not very structured rather it grew in response to the growing 
                need for just and equitable development. But over the last decade, the face of 
                the sector is undergoing through a change. There has been a remarkable increase 
                in the number of persons wanting to join the sector. The size and intensity of 
                the sector has increased by leaps and bounds over the last decade and the amount 
                of resources involved in the work of the development sector has also shot up 
                remarkably. A large amount of funds, both from within as well as outside the 
                country are being utilized for the purpose of development work. This creates a 
                need for better financial management practices, a more professional approach in 
                the sector as a whole.

<br style="line-height:12px ">
                The one year Diploma in Financial Management and Accountability aims at building 
                the capacity of individuals wanting to join the sector as well as for persons 
                already working in the sector in the areas of financial management and thereby 
                promoting transparency and accountability in the sector.
<br>
<br style="line-height:12px ">
                The financial management practices determine the effectiveness, accountability 
                and transparency of the sector to a large extent. Even though some degree, 
                diploma, or certificate programmes on rural management, management of non-profit 
                organizations and related subjects are being offered by different institutions 
                to cater to the needs of the voluntary sector, there still exists an unmet 
                demand for specific capacity building in the area of financial management of 
                voluntary organizations (VOs). This Diploma programme is designed to meet that 
                unmet need in the voluntary sector. 
<br>
<br style="line-height:12px ">
                The overall objective of the programme is to promote accountability in the 
                sector by strengthening the financial management practices and by building 
                individual capacities.
